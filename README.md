# PLEASE READ BEFORE MARKING

The data.json file in this repo was previously used by me for testing. You may delete it before running, as it is created upon first submission. If you don't, you will see my test data included with the results you add, as data is correctly read and written to ensure it persists accross runs.

node_modules is not included, as per lab instructions.
